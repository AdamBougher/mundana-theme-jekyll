Some of the Intellectual Property may have commercial value that needs to be protected through patenting and copyright protection mechanisms.

Per the Policy, all persons subject to these regulations will promptly disclose in writing all Inventions that they create.  
  
The University (or its designee) has sole authority to negotiate with third parties for license agreements granting the right to use, develop, or otherwise commercialize University-owned Inventions.
