## Concept Ideation
We provide facilitated brainstorming sessions to help you fully explore opportunities and work through roadblocks.  
## Invention Disclosures  
Certain intellectual property created by NIU faculty, staff, students, and on-campus guests must be reported to the Office of Innovation. Click here to review the NIU Intellectual Property Policy to see how it applies to you. If you have an invention to disclose to the Office of Innovation click the button below.  
## Partner Connections  
We can assist with facilitating collaborations and identify potential licensees for marketing of your inventions/technologies.<br>
## Agreements (Non-Disclosures, Material Transfer, Licenses) <br>
We will review, facilitate, and, where necessary, negotiate agreements on behalf of the inventor. An NDA keeps your ideas a secret. An MTA maintains control of your materials. A license makes it possible for partners to develop your invention or technology. We can help with any and all of these things.<br>
