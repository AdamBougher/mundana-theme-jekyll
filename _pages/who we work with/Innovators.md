## Concept Ideation
We provide facilitated brainstorming sessions to help you fully explore opportunities and work through roadblocks.  
## Invention Disclosures  
Certain intellectual property created by NIU faculty, staff, students, and on-campus guests must be reported to the Office of Innovation.  
<a href="https://www.niu.edu/policies/policy-documents/intellectual-property-policy.shtml">Click here</a> to review the NIU Intellectual Property Policy to see how it applies to you.  
If you have an invention to disclose to the Office of Innovation <a href="https://eadn-wc03-7444372.nxedge.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/invention-disclosure-form.pdf">Click Here</a>  
## Partner Connections  
We can assist with facilitating collaborations and identify potential licensees for marketing of your inventions/technologies.<br>
## Agreements (Non-Disclosures, Material Transfer, Licenses) <br>
We will review, facilitate, and, where necessary, negotiate agreements on behalf of the inventor. An NDA keeps your ideas a secret. An MTA maintains control of your materials. A license makes it possible for partners to develop your invention or technology. We can help with any and all of these things.<br>
